Project 1 is a BitTorrent Client. Given a torrent file, the client program can contact the tracker and fetch information about other seeders. The program then performs download and/or upload from other seeders through TCP. The beauty of this program is that it can download segments of the target file from multiple seeders in parallel and thus accelerating the download.
